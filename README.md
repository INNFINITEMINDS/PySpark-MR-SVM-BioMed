# Python-Spark-MapReduce-ML
A compile of Python scripts for applying Spark MapReduce and Machine Learning. The application case is computing allele requencies from individual VCF files and distinguishing normal and disease samples based on coded genotypic data. 

I am working on this repository and codes will come soon.
